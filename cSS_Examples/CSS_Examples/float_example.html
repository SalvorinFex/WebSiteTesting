<body>
<h1 style="width:290px; float:left;">This is my headline</h1>
<p style="font-size:120%">And this is some text which explains 
how the property works. The below example demonstrates the same
example with an image instead of a headline. Some more text here

<img src="http://www.topxml.com/images/topxml_site.gif" style="float:right;">
<p style="font-size:120%">This example shows an image next to the text.
This is the style which many newspaper articles use. As you can see the 
usage is very easy. Just simple apply the float property with one of the 
following values: left, right, none. This line should be floated under the 
image now.</p>

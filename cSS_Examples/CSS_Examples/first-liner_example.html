<h1>Pseudo element: first-line demonstration</h1>
<font face="verdana">
<p>This is the first paragraph of the page. As you can see the first-line element highlights the first sentence of the word. Although the first sentence is spanned in two lines, it only changes the style of the first line.paragraph feature eh?
</p>
<p>Of course you can do as with other paragraphs too :)</p>
